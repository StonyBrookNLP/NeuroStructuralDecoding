NEUROSTRUCTURAL DECODING is a new decoding algorithm that incorporates syntactic constraints to further improve the quality of the generated text. We build NEUROSTRUCTURAL DECODING on the NeuroLogic Decoding (Lu et al., 2021) algorithm, which enables language generation models to produce fluent text while satisfying complex lexical constraints. It tracks lexico-syntactic constraints  during decoding by parsing the partial generations at each step.

### Example
In the following example we see an example that compares the output produced by Neurologic Decoding with lexical constraints alone vs. the output generated by NEUROSTRUCTURAL DECODING with lexico-syntactic constraints.
